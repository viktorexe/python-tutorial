# List is like a shopping list in which we can store multiple items together 

my_list = ['apple', 'banana'] # Square brackets are used 

# We can add/remove/change the elements of a list

my_list2 = [11, 11.1, 232, 'apple', 'banana'] # Multiple datatypes can be stored in a list

'''
In a list the first element has 
the serial number 0
for example in my_list the 'apple' element has 
0 as serial number and we can replace or print it 
'''

print(my_list[0]) # prints apple
my_list[0] = 'orange' # replaced apple with orange 
print(my_list) # Will print new list with orange in place of apple
