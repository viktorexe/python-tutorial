# This is our first program in python!
# The print statement is used to print some lines, the text must be within " " or ' ' 

print("Hello World")
print(5) # We can print integers directly without ''
print(9+9) # Numbers can be added inside and it prints 18 but if enclosed in '' it considers it as string (String means words)
